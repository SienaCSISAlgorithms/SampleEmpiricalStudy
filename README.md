# Sample Empirical Study

This is an example of an empirical study similar to those that are
required for some problem sets in our Analysis of Algorithms course.

In the BruteForceClosestPairs directory, you will find a Java program
that implements the algorithm being analyzed, a bash script that runs
it repeatedly for various problem sizes, the data files generated,
gnuplot scripts to generate graphs, and the graphs generated by those
scripts.

In the writeup directory, you will find the LaTeX source and the PDF
generated by that LaTeX source for a sample writeup.
